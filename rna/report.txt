CS 519-005, Algorithms (MS/MEng-level), Fall 2016
Challenge Problem - RNA Structure Prediction (6%)

Due electronically on Canvas on Tuesday Nov 29, 11:59pm.
No late submission will be accepted.

Include in your submission: report.txt, rna.py.
Grading: 
* report.txt -- 1%
* 1-best structure -- 2%       
* number of structures -- 1%  -- cf. hw5 number of binary trees
* k-best structures -- 2%     -- cf. hw4/midterm/hw7 nbest problem

***Please answer time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.

1. I use dictionary to store each result.
if the first pair (i,j) matched, reducing it to subproblem (i+1,j-1).
Or it could be separated to two substring with pointer k to solve two substring.

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n^2)

2. Total number of all possible structures (related to Catalan numbers)
I examined the first character to pair remained string, if not, reduce to the strng(1:j)
then searched the string to compared rna[0] and rna[k], where k from 1 to j
then solve the subproblem total(i+1,k-1) and total(k+1,j)

Time complexity: O(n^2)
Space complexity: O(n^2)

3. k-best structures: return a list containing the 1-best, 2nd-best, 
   ..., the kth-best structures.

Time complexity: O(n^3)
Space complexity: O(n^3)

I use heap to store the result from question 1, than pop it.
