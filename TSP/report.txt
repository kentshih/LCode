HW8 - DP (part 3)

Due electronically on Canvas on Monday Nov 14, 11:59pm.
No late submission will be accepted.

Include in your submission: report.txt, lis.py, tsp.py.
lis.py will be graded for correctness (1%).

Please answer time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.

0. (a) Describe a greedy algorithm for LIS and show a counter example.
   pick smallest as start and find LIS
   counter: azbcd
   (b) Describe an exhaustive algorithm for TSP and analyze complexity.
   expand from one city to every city to find TSP solution
   Time complexity: O(V^2n^2)

1. [WILL BE GRADED]
   Longest (Strictly) Increasing Subsequence
   
   input/output are lower-case strings:

   >>> lis("aebbcg")
   "abcg"

   >>> lis("zyx")
   "z"

   tiebreaking: arbitrary. any optimal solution is ok.

   Q: What are the time and space complexities?

   filename: lis.py 

2. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
   
   Given an undirected graph of n nodes (0..n-1) representing a road network,
   the traveling salesman has to start from city 0 and visit each city
   once and only once, and return to city 0. Find the minimum-length tour (cycle)
   that satisifies these conditions.
   
   You can use whatever input/output format.
   
   Write the subproblem definition, recurrence relation, and space/time complexities in report.txt.
   OPT(n,{(u,v,w)}) : travel n countries

   Include at least three testcases.
   OPT(2,[(0,1,10),(1,0,5))
