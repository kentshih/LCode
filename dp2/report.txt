Please answer time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.

[UPDATE]
0. For each of the coding problems below:
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 

1. Unbounded Knapsack

   You have n items, each with weight w_i and value v_i, and has infinite copies.
   **All numbers are positive integers.**
   What's the best value for a bag of W?

   >>> best(3, [(2, 4), (3, 5)])
   (5, [0, 1])

   the input to the best() function is W and a list of pairs (w_i, v_i).
   this output means to take 0 copies of item 1 and 1 copy of item 2.

   tie-breaking: *reverse* lexicographical: i.e., [1, 0] is better than [0, 1]:
   (i.e., take as much from item 1 as possible, etc.)

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(3, [(1, 5), (1, 5)])
   (15, [3, 0])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(3, [(1, 2), (1, 5)])
   (15, [0, 3])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(3, [(1, 2), (2, 5)])
   (7, [1, 1])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(58, [(5, 9), (9, 18), (6, 12)])
   (114, [2, 4, 2])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(92, [(8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 12), (5, 6)])
   (109, [1, 1, 7, 1])

   Q: What are the time and space complexities?
   Time: O(nw)
   Space: O(n)

   filename: knapsack_unbounded.py

   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   Find every capacity with evey items.
   Time: O(n^w)
   Space: O(n*w)
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   Choose the most varible item as possible
   Time: O(nw)
   Space: O(n)
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (5,[(2,7),(1,3)])
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   Top-down, because some capacity is uncessary to calculate.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
   (5,[(2,7),(1,3)])
   Top-down: 5->3->1->0
   Bottom-up: 0->1->2->3->4->5 

2. [WILL BE GRADED] 
   Bounded Knapsack

   You have n items, each with weight w_i and value v_i, and has c_i copies.
   **All numbers are positive integers.**
   What's the best value for a bag of W?

   >>> best(3, [(2, 4, 2), (3, 5, 3)])
   (5, [0, 1])

   the input to the best() function is W and a list of triples (w_i, v_i, c_i).

   tie-breaking: same as in p1:

   >>> best(3, [(1, 5, 2), (1, 5, 3)])
   (15, [2, 1])

   >>> best(3, [(1, 5, 1), (1, 5, 3)])
   (15, [1, 2])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best(20, [(1, 10, 6), (3, 15, 4), (2, 10, 3)])
   (130, [6, 4, 1])

   [UPDATE]
   >>> best((92, [(1, 6, 6), (6, 15, 7), (8, 9, 8), (2, 4, 7), (2, 20, 2)])
   (236, [6, 7, 3, 7, 2])

   Q: What are the time and space complexities?
   Time:O(nw)
   Space: O(n)

   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   Find every capacity with evey items.
   Time: O(n^w)
   Space: O(n*w)
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   Choose the most varible item as possible
   Time: O(nw)
   Space: O(n)
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (5,[(2,7,2),(1,3,1)])
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   Top-down, because some capacity is uncessary to calculate.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
   (5,[(2,7,2),(1,3,1)])
   Top-down: 5->3->1->0
   Bottom-up: 0->1->2->3->4->5 

   filename: knapsack_bounded.py

3. [UPDATE: OPTIONAL]
   Longest (Strictly) Increasing Subsequence
   
   input/output are lower-case strings:

   >>> lis("aebbcg")
   "abcg"

   >>> lis("zyx")
   "z"

   tiebreaking: arbitrary. any optimal solution is ok.

   Q: What are the time and space complexities?
   Time: O(n)
   Space: O(n)

   filename: lis.py 

   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   Find every capacity with evey items.
   Time: O(n^2)
   Space: O(n^2)
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   Choose the most varible item as possible
   Time: O(n)
   Space: O(n)
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   (aazzzz)
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   Top-down, because some capacity is uncessary to calculate.
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists) 
   (aazzzzb)
   Top-down: aazzzzb->azzzzb->zzzzb->zzzb->zzb->zb
   Bottom-up: b->zb->zzb->zzzb->zzzzb->azzzzb->aazzzzb


PLEASE COME UP WITH MORE TESTCASES FOR EACH PROBLEM! 
THESE EXISTING CASES ARE WAY TOO TRIVIAL.
